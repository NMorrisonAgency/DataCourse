# DataCourse
This is for my data analysis course. I looked at the Human Resources Analysis data files, and more specifically attrition, job satisfaction and monthly income among salespeople. 
The following statistics were analyzed: average monthly income, minimum monthly income and maximum monthly income.This was further broken down by salespeople with attrition and those without attrition. 
The visualizations folder contains the findings from the analysis.
